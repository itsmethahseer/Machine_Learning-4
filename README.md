# Machine_Learning-4
In this machine learning i solved unsupervised algorithm like clustering.
In this i discussed about clustering algorithms like k-means, DBSCAN and Hirarchichal clusterings.And discussed about Ensemble techniques lile boosting and bagging .
In bagging i will be solved random forest regressor and in boosting i will be discussing about Adaboost, Gradient boost and XGboost algorithms.
I hope you guys enjoy it.Thank you
